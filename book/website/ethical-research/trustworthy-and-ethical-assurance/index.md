# Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance

## Prerequisites
| Prerequisite | Importance | Notes |
| [Introduction to Research Ethics](../ethics-intro.md) | Helpful | If you have never taken a course in research ethics, it would be useful to review some of the main principles and values prior to exploring 'Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance'. The latter is a framework to help scaffold ethical reflection, deliberation, and communication. Therefore, it presumes familarity with salient ethical values and principles. |
| [Self Reflection](../self-reflection.md) | Helpful | Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance is a framework for ethical reflection, deliberation, and communication. As such, having a general understanding of self-reflection is desirable but not essential. |

## Summary
This chapter explores a framework for ethical reflection, deliberation, and communication, known as 'Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance' (or, TEA for short).
The chapter begins by introducing TEA, explaining how it complements values and principles for [research ethics](../ethics-intro.md), and then develops on these principles by providing a more structured process for documenting and communicating the actions or decisions taken across a research project's lifecycle.
We also explore how the TEA framework utilises the [FAIR principles](../../reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.md) to provide a novel approach to assurance that is well-suited to application areas such as data science and artificial intelligence (i.e. data-driven technologies). 

Central to the TEA framework, and discussed in this chapter, are the following:

1. The TEA Platform: An open-source tool for creating and sharing assurance cases.
2. Argument Pattens: Generalisable patterns and templates for creating assurance cases, which focus on key ethical principles (e.g. explainability).

## Motivation
The Turing Way is a community of practice grounded in open science and open source software.
Similarly, the TEA platform is a piece of research infrastructure that supports open, reproducible, and collaborative approaches to ethical decision-making.
