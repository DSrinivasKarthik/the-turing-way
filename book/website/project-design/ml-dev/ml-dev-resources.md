Ensuring safety characteristics such as robustness, security, privacy, fairness, and transparency in machine learning pipelines is essential for building trust for the users of AI systems. These characteristics require a team effort and careful analysis of existing responsbilities of the development team members. Teams should maintain governance and risk management recipes to achieve high performance, equitable outcomes and accountability. 

This chapter outlined a fairness-oriented approach to machine learning project design, providing guidance on building reproducible, explainable, and unbiased models. As you apply the presented strategies, youâ€™ll be better equipped to develop ML systems that align with both organizational goals and social responsibilities, promoting responsible AI practices in real-world applications.
