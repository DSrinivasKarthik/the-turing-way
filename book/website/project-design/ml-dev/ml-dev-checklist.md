# Checklist

> **#TODO:**
> List out the action points you want the readers to take based on the key ideas in your chapter.
> Aim for three action points for each topic, however, you can have more than this threshold.
> Aim for a through checklist that can help developers to review all steps of ML Pipelines.

The Turing Way chapters traditionally include a checklist to summarize the key content points. Below is a checklist for developers of ML-powered systems to consider throughout the project. This chapter provides an only introductory overview of these questions.

- [ ] Is using ML essential for this project?
- [ ] What are the goals and success metrics?
- [ ] What standards or guidelines should be used to assess and manage risks?
- [ ] How can I gather data that is both useful and ethical?
- [ ] How can I train the ML model sustainably and maintainably?
- [ ] How will I monitor the deployed model and address potential data drift?


The following resources present a deeper exploration of best practices and development techniques:
