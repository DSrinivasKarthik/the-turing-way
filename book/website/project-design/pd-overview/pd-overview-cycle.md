## Project cycle

The success of any project hinges upon effective management and a well-defined project cycle. In this chapter, we will explore the key phases of the project cycle, from initiation to closure, and discuss the essential components within each stage. It is critical for researchers, programmers and practitioners to understand and implement a structured approach to project management. This will not only enhance their ability to maximise outcomes but also to effectively manage resources.

### Initiation

The initiation phase sets the foundation for the project and involves defining its purpose, scope, and objectives. A rush to initiate the project without giving a time risks compromising the project deliverables and outcomes. The following components play a critical role in project initiation:

- Project Charter: A project charter outlines the project's vision, objectives, stakeholders, and key deliverables. It serves as a reference document that guides decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

- Contracts: Establishing contracts with relevant parties ensures clarity regarding roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Contracts can include agreements with collaborators, industry, academics, vendors, or other project partners.

- Governance: Governance frameworks provide a structure for decision-making, risk management, and stakeholder engagement. The governance framework helps maintain project accountability and ensures compliance with relevant regulations.

### Planning

The planning phase involves defining project activities, deliverables, allocating resources, and creating a roadmap for project execution or delivery plan. Key components of the planning phase include:

- Risk Register: A risk register identifies potential risks and outlines strategies to mitigate or manage them. It enables proactive risk management and helps project teams anticipate and address potential obstacles.

- IP Register: An intellectual property (IP) register documents any intellectual property considerations, including copyrights, patents, or licenses associated with the project. It ensures that intellectual property rights are properly protected and managed.

- Delivery Plans/Milestones: Delivery plans establish the project timeline, milestones, and deliverables. They help project teams monitor progress, allocate resources effectively, and stay on track towards project completion.

- Logic models: logical frameworks are akin to the blueprints we use for planning and evaluating programmes aimed at long-term impact, such as social change.

(pd-overview-cycle-execution)=
### Execution

The execution phase involves putting the project plan into action and managing project activities. Key components of the execution phase include:

- Project Boards: Project boards provide oversight and guidance during the project's execution. They typically consist of key stakeholders who review project progress, provide feedback, and make critical decisions. It can also be organised in an RACI matrix.

- Budgets: It involves monitoring and controlling project expenditures, ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately, and making adjustments as needed.

(pd-overview-cycle-monitoring)=
### Monitoring
The monitoring phase focuses on tracking project performance, identifying deviations from the plan, and making necessary adjustments. Components of the monitoring phase include:

- Reporting: Regular reporting enables project teams to communicate progress, risks, and issues to stakeholders. It promotes transparency and facilitates informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

- Forecasts: Forecasting involves predicting future project outcomes based on current progress and performance data. It helps project teams anticipate challenges, assess resource needs, and make data-driven decisions.

(pd-overview-cycle-everywhere)=
### Everywhere

Throughout the project cycle, the project team must remain vigilant in identifying and addressing problems that arise. This includes promptly resolving issues, managing conflicts, and fostering effective communication to ensure project success.

(pd-overview-cycle-closing)=
### Closing

The closing phase involves wrapping up the project, capturing lessons learned, and transitioning project outcomes. Key components of the closing phase include:

- Project Legacy: Documenting the project legacy ensures that the knowledge, deliverables, and best practices generated during the project are captured and can be shared with the wider research community. This helps foster continuous improvement and supports future projects.
