    Early Career Researchers (ECRs) are students, PhDs and early-stage postdocs
    who may not have a lot of experience in contributing to research projects
    from start to finish. This curated set of chapters will allow them to
    understand what best practices apply at different stages of development to
    ensure research reproducibility.

    From research to government, every sector strongly relies upon the use of
    research software. This curated set of chapters guides the sharing and
    citation of software components from source code to computational workflows
    and executables while attributing all contributors fairly.

    There would be times when collaboration would be needed across multiple
    nations to build, nurture, and strengthen best practices in open
    science/source. These curated chapters are a guide to aid this
    collaboration and foster a practice that would guarantee the best possible
    outcomes.
