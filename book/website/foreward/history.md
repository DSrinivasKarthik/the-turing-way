# History of *The Turing Way* project

## Founding (2018 - 2019)

*The Turing Way* is the flagship project of the Tools, Practices, and Systems programme.
Founded by Dr Kirstie Whitaker, _The Turing Way_ began as a Book of Reproducible Research in 2019.
Dr. Whitaker brought together a team of [allies and contributors](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md#previous-project-members), who were already championing reproducible practices in data science, to co-develop the first version of **The Turing Way** book.
The project team included researchers, librarians, data scientists and Research Engineers, from both The Alan Turing Turing and the institutes across the UK and was funded by The Alan Turing Institute.
The project has its roots in the [Mozilla Open Leadership](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/), a programme that led to Kirstie's Mozilla Fellowship in 2016, which influenced her as a researcher and strengthened her commitment to working openly.

*The Turing Way* has been funded by The Alan Turing Institute since the very beginning.
Due to close relationships with the Jupyter Project, the book was written in JupyterBook.
A GitHub repository was made for the project, and internal processes decided in how to acknowledge authorship works within the project (i.e. installation of Welcome bot, All-Contributors bot) and collaborative spaces and events to contribute to the guides were created (such as the Collaboration Cafe and Book Dash).
In-person workshops were given on tools aligned with the project (particulary Binder and JupterBook).
The project was presented in many conferences across the UK and internationally.

## Development and Growth (2019-2021)

With the addition of Dr. Malvika Sharan in late 2019 as the community manager, *The Turing Way* continued to evolve and grow as it received more support and visibility.
Malvika helped to incubate what are now key partnerships for ***The Turing Way*** within the wider 'open science' ecosystem, and helped to usher in the expansion of the project.
This period corresponded with the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, which transitioned many processes of contribution, collaboration, and documentation into remote ones.
For many, it also became clear that reproducibility on its own is not sufficient to address the major challenges (including incentive challenges!) faced by research data scientists.

In part due to all these factors, *The Turing Way* was able to expand greatly, from one guide on reproducibility into five different guides related to project design, communication, collaboration, and research ethics.

A global (and multilingual) community began to engage with *The Turing Way*, and the process of translation/localisation began informally.
A Community Handbook was also established to document best practices that could be used by other communities.
The Fireside Chat series was established in late 2021, facilitating shared spaces with networks and allies from across the open science ecosystem.
The project received a few awards & citations in the 2021 London Mayor report, HiddenREF Awards, and Goldacre Report.
The Book Dash Planning Committe was established in early 2022 to plan the community's flagship collaboration event.

## Maintenance & Sustainability (2022-Ongoing)

In 2022, Malvika and Kirstie became co-leads of *The Turing Way*, and welcomed Anne Lee Steele as the new community manager.
As the number of contributors to the project has grown to over 400 people, The Turing Way has also developed into a kind of ["community of communities"](https://ben.balter.com/2019/07/18/a-community-of-communities-oscon-2019/).
Many ongoing projects have been developing alongside the expansion of the guides, demonstrating the need for internal systems that enable the sustainability and maintenance of the project more broadly.
Many projects have grown that have adopted and used practices from *The Turing Way*.
The core team of the project, which brought together Turing staff and volunteer leaders of the project was brought in in 2022.

Initial governance work began in 2022 with hybrid hubs hosting events across multiple time zones and working groups developed to formalise localisation and translation, reviewing & editing, training and mentorship, accessibility, and infrastructure within the project.
The number of talks and workshops given by community members also expanded.

In 2023, *The Turing Way* delivery team expanded, with the addition of Alexandra Araujo Alvarez as TTW's first Project Manager.
The Practioner's Hub was incubated with 5 Experts-in-Residence (EiR) that aims to bring *The Turing Way* into the hands and ways of working of industry leaders.
The open infrastructure of the project has also expanded, as *The Turing Way* moved to separate Github organisation.

In 2024, there will be even more changes for the project as governance continues to develop and see its sustainability solidify, alongside supporting a vibrant open ecosystem.

You can learn more about the project's origin story in this [Fireside Chat recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuNA3Qa8A-k) from December 2022 or this [2018 article](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/changing-culture-data-science) from the Alan Turing Institute website.

It is important to note (and as you'll likely hear time and time again!) that while The Alan Turing Institute hosts **The Turing Way**, it is meant to be a **Turing-agnostic** project. **The Turing Way** has been created (and continues to be maintained) by a global network of scholars, practioners, experts, graduate students, developers, and more.
