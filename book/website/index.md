# Welcome

_Welcome to The Turing Way Handbook to Reproducible, Ethical, and Collaborative Data Science._

_The Turing Way_ is an open source book, a global collaboration and a supportive community.
We involve and collaborate with a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and beneficial for everyone.

```{admonition} Top Tip
:class: tip
_The Turing Way_ is not meant to be read from start to finish. Start with what interests you!
Whether it's a concept, a tool, or a method you need right now, jump in.
Browse the different guides or use the search box â€”
it's all about what you want to learn.
```

Our moonshot goal is to make reproducibility "too easy not to do"! 
Whether you are a researcher, coder, project leader, community connector, funder, policymaker, or just curious about data, your unique role is crucial in this journey.

Let's make data science inclusive, together!

## Different Pathways


(welcome-community)=
## Join _The Turing Way_

Our goal is to provide individuals and organizations in academia, industry, government, and the public sectors the information they need to ensure that their projects are easy to reproduce and reuse. 
We encourage all stakeholders in data science to utilise _The Turing Way_ to understand their roles and responsibilities for reproducibility.

**What Awaits You**

* Collaboration Beyond Boundaries: Engage in a global collaboration that transcends borders and welcomes diverse perspectives.
* Skill Development: Learn a skills, share a skill that you have and contribute to projects in making a real impact.
* Learn, Remix, Reuse: Dive into our resources, and feel free to remix and reuse materials (just remember to attribute as per our [License](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md)].

**Calling Everyone In: Your Participation and Perspectives Matter!**

The Turing Way community is a open and collaborative space. 
It is an ecosystem where all stakeholders of data science come together to make research "too easy not to do." 
We invest in socio-technical skills, fostering a team spirit to build something greater than any individual effort.

```{admonition} Translation
:class: tip
Call for translators! Weâ€™re looking for contributors to help translate this space for everyone! Read more about our translation workflow and how you can contribute to it in the {ref}`translation chapter<ch-translation>`.

We are committed to creating a space where more people with diverse expertise and lived experiences can share their knowledge with others to allow us all to use data science to make a positive impact on the world.
We hope you find the book helpful and join us in co-creating and maintaining _The Turing Way_.
We welcome you to our community!

(welcome-history)=
## History

The story of _The Turing Way_ began in January 2019 as a guide for reproducibility, focusing on essential technical skills like {ref}`rr-vcs`, {ref}`rr-testing` and {ref}`rr-ci`. However, technical proficiency was just one piece of the puzzle in making data science research "open for all."
In February 2020, The Turing Way embarked on an exciting evolution, expanding into a comprehensive series of guides, covering {ref}`reproducibility<rr>`, {ref}`project design<pd>`, {ref}`collaboration<cl>`, {ref}`communication<cm>` and {ref}`research ethics<er>`.

This transformation wasn't just about adding more content; it was about embracing a holistic approach to empower a diverse community of contributors. 
_The Turing Way_ is a perpetual 'work in progress,' shaped by the collective efforts of international contributors from research institutes, universities, government departments, and industry internationally.

(welcome-team)=
## Project Team and Governance

The project is hosted under the Turing Institute's [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) research programme and co-led by **Drs. Kirstie Whitaker** and **Malvika Sharan**.
The project is coordinated and managed by the Research Community Manager **Anne Lee Steele** and Research Project Manager **Alexandra Araujo Alvarez**.

As of December 2023, the projectâ€™s governance is represented by [30+ members and leaders](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) from our volunteer community and the Turing researchers.
They lead or contribute to different subprojects within _The Turing Way_, that you can learn about in the {ref}`afterword section<subprojects>`.

The book has been co-authored by 450+ project contributors dedicated to sharing and facilitating research best practices, tools and infrastructure.
Each chapter is a result of large collaboration, attributed to _The Turing Way_ community, where every contributor is a co-author. 
Several of our community members and contributors take on non-governance roles in _The Turing Way_ project and our community.
Learn about them in {ref}`contributors-record`.

Join us as we continue to shape the future of open science and make data science accessible to all!
