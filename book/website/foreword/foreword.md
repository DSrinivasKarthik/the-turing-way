<<<<<<< HEAD
_The Turing Way_ is open for anyone to use, contribute to and share. 
You can inspect our resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), contribute to the project as described in our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and re-use all materials ([see the License](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).

Although _The Turing Way_ core team is located in London (UK) and receives support from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the project is designed to be a global collaboration.
Chapters have been written, reviewed and curated by members from international research institutes and universities, government departments, and industry.

The foreword section of _The Turing Way_ handbook currently provides the following information:
- {ref}`Background and history<fw-history>`

We are committed to creating a space where people with diverse expertise and lived experiences can share their knowledge with others, and help us use data science to improve the world.

This is an introductory section of _The Turing Way_ as a project, a handbook, and a community.
Here you will find chapters providing contexts and background on the book, how you can use it, how you can contribute to different aspects of the project, and how you can participate in this community.

The project lead and founder, Kirstie Whitaker, discusses "Emergent Strategy" and how it has inspired her leadership and the foundation of _The Turing Way_.
Co-lead, Malvika Sharan, also shares her reflections from working with the community and how _The Turing Way_ applies approaches that underpin the "Principles of Digital Commons."

Finally, we provide details on community roles, citation process and frequently asked questions to help identify the right places for you to get involved.

You will find these details in the following chapters:

- {ref}`fw-background`
- {ref}`fw-navigating`
- {ref}`fw-emergent-strategy`
- {ref}`fw-embracing-digital-commons`
- {ref}`fw-community`
- {ref}`fw-governance`
- {ref}`fw-cite`
- {ref}`fw-faqs`
