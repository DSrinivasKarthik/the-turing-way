## History of The Turing Way project

## Founding (2018 - 2019)

*The Turing Way* is the flagship project of the Tools, Practices, and Systems. Founded by Dr. Kirstie Whitaker, the project began as a Book of Reproducible Research in 2018, created by Dr. Whitaker and close allies and partners: assisted in creation by  working with members of the REG team at the Turing. The project was incubated during Kirstie's time as a [Mozilla Open Leader](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/), and was funded by a grant within the Turing. Due to close relationships with the Jupyter Project, the book was written in a JupyterBook, and hosted openly on Github. The first 'book dash' was held in person, with workshops on Binder held across the UK.

## Development and Growth (2019-2021)

With the addition of Dr. Malvika Sharan in late 2019, The Turing Way expanded into five guides. As a co-founder of Open Life Science (which uses many Mozilla OL frameworks), Malvika helped to incubate what are now key partnerships for The Turing Way. With other key collaborators, she facilitated the creation of 4 more guides (on Project Design, Collaboration, Community, and Research Ethics), alongside a Community Handbook that captured meta-practices by and for other open source communities. The scope and project expanded massively during the 2020-2022 period, as well as transitioned online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Maintenance & Sustainability (2022-Ongoing)

In 2022, Malvika and Kirstie became co-leads of *The Turing Way*, and welcomed Anne Lee Steele as the new community manager. The Turing Way team now counts more than 30 members as "Core Team". The Turing Way has also developed into a kind of ["community of communities"](https://ben.balter.com/2019/07/18/a-community-of-communities-oscon-2019/), as people in the community work on projects related to localisation and translation, reviewing & editing, training and mentorship, accessibility, and infrastructure. Initial governance work began in 2022, with hybrid hubs hosting events across time zones.

2023 aims to usher even more changes for the project, with the development of The Turing Way Practioner's Hub that aims to bring The Turing Way into the hands and ways of working of industry leaders. This project will hopefully see the as governance continues to develop, and see its sustainability solidify, alongside supporting a vibrant open ecosystem. It also saw an expansion of the team, with the addition of Alexandra Araujo Alvarez as TTW's first Project Manager.

You can learn more about the project's origin story in this [Fireside Chat recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuNA3Qa8A-k) from December 2022 or this [2018 article](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/changing-culture-data-science) from the Alan Turing Institute website.

It is important to note (and as you'll likely hear time and time again!) that while The Alan Turing Institute hosts *The Turing Way*, it is meant to be a **Turing-agnostic** project. *The Turing Way* has been created (and continues to be maintained) by a global network of scholars, practioners, experts, graduate students, developers, and more.
