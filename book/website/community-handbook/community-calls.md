# _The Turing Way_ Community Calls

The Turing Way community has a series of community calls organised throughout the year. 

These calls may vary from collaboration and working calls, to organisational meetings, to public share-outs that demonstrate transparency, to a mixture of all of the above.

Generally, these calls are organised online using the Zoom platform.

{ref}`Book Dash<ch-bookdash>` and the {ref}`Fireside Chat series<ch-fireside-chat>` are documented separately, but also overlap with many of the principles and practices shared in this section.

On each page, you can learn more about each type of community call, which are roughly organised into three types: community coworking calls, organising and planning calls, and public celebratoin calls.

More broadly, we want to make collaborative events like these as useful as possible for as many people as possible.
Please [let the team members know](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way#get-in-touch) if there are other ways we can make these calls more welcoming and helpful for you.

## 1. Community Coworking calls

The concept of coworking is generally associated with the practice of sharing physical office space with different people who work independently such as remote employees or freelancers.
This allows people, who otherwise may feel isolated while working alone at home, to use traditional office setups, create a work routine, and build a sense of companionship with others who they share their office spaces with.

_The Turing Way_ community is distributed around the world.
Our members are from diverse backgrounds, different skills and interests, working many different jobs, and contribute to this project for a great variety of reasons.
They are also, for the most part, unpaid to contribute to this open source project.

We bring the practice of coworking to _The Turing Way_ using online coworking calls, through which we intend to develop a sense of energy and inspiration similar to in-person interactions but without the time and travel commitments.

Our coworking calls provide opportunities for community members to allocate time to their desired tasks in _The Turing Way_ and get them done, partially or fully, with the support of others in the call who can help discuss their plans, share ideas or hold accountability.
```

you will learn about the motivation behind holding coworking calls, techniques we use for making effective use of the allocated time, the two types of calls we host: {ref}`Collaboration Cafes <ch-coworking-collabcafe>` and {ref}`Weekly Coworking<ch-coworking-weekly>`, and their formats.


## 2. Organising and planning calls

Community calls may also be used at spaces for organising and planning within _The Turing Way_ community.

This type of call could be used to assemble different parts of the project (i.e. the )

These calls may take on a more traditional meeting format, with a prepared agenda with particular points to be voted on by different members. Alternatively, it could also take on a 

Core Team calls may fall under this category.
