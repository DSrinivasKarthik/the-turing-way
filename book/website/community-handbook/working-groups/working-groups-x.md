# Guidelines for the WG 

All WGs, teams, and people within *The Turing Way* are responsible for adhering with our [Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc) and our (upcoming) [Accessibility Policy](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3145), both in organising WGs and facilitating WGs' activities.

Members of WGs will be responsible for establishing their group structures that that are:
1. **Open & Transparent** for others to learn about, and join in on;
2. **Inclusive** for all kinds of people and expertise;
3. **Accessible** to join and participate in.

Each WG will also be responsible to document their ways of working and ongoing projects.
WGs should discuss specific support they might need in their work with the *The Turing Way* team, specifically our Research Community Manager (but you can each out to any of the co-leads and project manager too!).

In this subchapter, we discuss the roles and responsibilities of WG, in the next subchapter you will learn about how to propose and manage a WG.

## WG Structure and Roles

We provide example of structure and roles for different members in the WG.
However, please note that the roles suggested below are not meant to be permanent (for example, a WG chair should not be a permanent appointee), but rather a guiding structure that WGs can begin their work with, and then expand, remix, and reuse for their own purposes.
All roles may be temporarily appointments or long-term, as agreed within the WG.

One person may occupy multiple roles. 
However, one person should not chair multiple WGs, in order to enable diffusion of responsibilities and ensure representation of different members in leadership roles. 

Community members can join any number of WGs, however, we discourage joining more than one or two WGs to prevent over-extension of individuals within the community.

Roles are suggested not in order to create hierarchy within a WG, but to enable the smooth operation and maintenance of the collective team, as well as to define responsibilities clearly (and avoid tyranny of structurelessness).

### Chair and Co-Chairs

These person(s) are responsible for the creation and continuation of a WG. 
Chairs provide leadership and facilitating the WGs work.
Chairs are responsible for organising and chairing meetings, ensuring that the responsibilities are fairly distributed, and ensuring the broader accountability of the assembled group. 
While this role may be occupied by multiple people, it is important to establish how each person upholds the responsibilities of a chair in an equitable way. 

The Chair will serve as the "Liason" for *The Turing Way* leadership, and will participate in meetings where the representation from the WG in wider governance spaces might be needed. 
Chairs will also be responsible for relaying feedback, announcements and discussions from the leadership or *The Turing Way* delivery team to the WG.
If a chair is unable to represent their WG in a specific meeting, they must identify a member from the WG who can represent the group and share notes from the meeting.

### Documentarian

The documentarian supports the WG in improving transparency around their work, so that those who are not yet part of the WG but are interested in their work can follow or engage with their work.
The documentarian is responsible for ensuring the logistical reporting of the group's work. 
They are are responsible for uploading meeting notes (without any private and sensitive information), helping the chair in time-keeping and communicating about the group's activities in a way that remain transparent, open, and accessible for others to access. 
For example, if the duties of the chair are distributed across multiple people, the documentarian is responsible for documenting this format in the WG's repository.

### Members

Any Turing Way community member may join a WG without restriction, and without taking on a leadership role.

### The Turing Way Delivery Team Contact

While WGs should be able to operate with autonomy in most decisions that apply to their work, sometimes they may require help from *The Turing Way* project delivery team to scope and trial/incubate their group, or when operational, invite support with logistics or resources needed. 
Each WG should have an assigned contact from the project delivery team, most likely either the project RCM or Project Manager.

## Infrastructure Requirements for WGs

- Dedicated Github Repository using the template provided in the GitHub organisation
    - Right permissions for members
- Dedicated Slack channel
- A shared document (such as Framapad) for meeting notes (that are archived on GitHub)
- Calendar invites with joining link (ask RCM for support if needed) for WG meetings

## Responsibilities

All WGs within the community should follow these three practices, as they relate to:
1. **Reciprocity** within and towards the broader Turing Way community;
2. **Open reporting** of practices and ways of working;
3. **Transparent decision-making** within the WG; 

### Reciprocity

All WGs within *The Turing Way* facilitate a reciprocal relationship with the wider community, as they represent a sustained engagement by community members on a topic or subject. 

This engagement can take a variety of forms, and can look like:
- Using Community Calls like the Collaboration Cafe for WG meetings, discussions, and/or ongoing co-working
- Hosting Fireside Chats and/or separate events (in consultation with and supported by the core staff delivery team) on topics related to the WG activities
- Documenting related practices and/or topics in *The Turing Way* guides, either in the Community Handbook or other ongoing guides within the project
- Creating a new guide related to the topics covered in the WG
- Collaborating with existing WGs on projects related to infrastructure, accessibility, translation or other themes

At minimum, all WGs are required to participate in and contribute to the *The Turing Way* Community Forums.
All community members are encouraged to attend these events.

### Transparency

All WG activities should be documented transparently so that non-WG members (and even non-Turing Way community members!) can learn about the WG's activities and projects. 

This will help to address questions like:
* How can more community members join in on WGs activities, or start their own?
* How visible are various WG's activities for the rest of the community?
* How can transparent reporting invite more people to participate in the conversation?

## Decision-making

In principle, primary decision-making should lie with the WG team itself. 
However, they may be different types of decisions that might require different people from across the project for consultation and support.

We recommend WGs to use the following questions to explore what kinds of decisions that may or may not require inputs, support or involvements from the project delivery team. 

- What decisions does WG feel *empowered to take as an autonomous WG*? (for example, Accessibility WG develops accessibility guidelines)
- What decisions does the WG want to invite *consultation and support* from the broader community? (for example, Book Dash WG invites support from community in planning their next agenda)
- What decisions WGs should involve *consultation and support* from the project delivery team or escalate to the leadership? (for example, Infrastructure WG will need input and approval when starting a new platform)
- What other decisions would WG want to make that don't fall under the above three categories?
