# Template for the Working Group's Charter

## *The Turing Way*  Working Group Charter: [GROUP's NAME HERE]

## Purpose

The [WORKING GROUP] will develop a Purpose and Need statement for the [PROJECT] and identify multiple alternatives that address that purpose and need. 

The [WORKING GROUP] will also help the project team in selecting the wisest course of action and preferred alternative. The preferred alternative will reflect consideration of various community goals, issues, environmental factors and concerns, and find the appropriate balance among competing interests.

## Advisory Group Goals

Advise [CONVENER] about key aspects of the project, provide a community perspective on key considerations, and be a sounding board for project deliverables.

Work towards consensus among [WORKING GROUP] members on the desired project goals, alternatives, construction phasing, and mitigation measures to include in the EIS.

## Project Outcome

The process will be considered a success if:

* The [WORKING GROUP] establishes clear, consensus-based recommendations on the best alternatives to include in the EIS;
* The public is engaged in a meaningful way in evaluating the proposed project alternatives and in reviewing and commenting on the project EIS;
* Project decisions fit into the context of the surrounding communities and recognize and respect the unique transportation needs along the corridor;
* The project schedule takes the least amount of time and makes the most effective use of limited project funding;
* Appropriate regulatory and government agency staff is involved throughout the process to avoid surprises that lead to delays.

## Terms of membership

Members agree to volunteer until the initiation of the EIS environmental review process and possibly through the EIS process.

A member’s position on the [WORKING GROUP] may be declared vacant if the member:

* Resigns from the [WORKING GROUP] (this should be in writing and forwarded to the [CONVENER])
* Fails to attend more than two meetings without prior notice

In a case where a member’s position is declared vacant, the [CONVENER] may appoint an alternative representative from the same interest group to fill the position.

## Working Group Operating Guidelines

### Convening of Meetings

## Decision Making

The [WORKING GROUP] is primarily advisory.

Partners will strive to work expeditiously and try to avoid revisiting decisions once made. If agreement cannot be reached on a particular issue, [CONVENER] will retain final decision-making authority.

## Conflict Resolution

When an issue arises that cannot be easily resolved, [WORKING GROUP] members agree to:

* Determine if the issue should be resolved within or outside of the [WORKING GROUP] and participate however is appropriate.
* Ensure the appropriate decision makers are at the table to resolve the issue.
