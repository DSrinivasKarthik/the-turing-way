# Setting up a WG

While any community member can join a WG, setting up a WG has a few extra steps, in order to assess both need and interest in the development of the WG, alongside sharing more information with the broader community.
This subchapter have been created to help with the creation of WGs, from brainstorming to establishing structure.

A few guiding questions that may help with this process:
* **Establish need**: What need does this WG fulfill for *The Turing Way* community?
* **Establish requirements**: Does this topic or type of work require ongoing support, or can it be contained into another format? (Should this be a WG, or can this task be accomplished in Collaboration Cafes?)
* **Establish membership**: Who would be a member of this WG currently (at time of founding)?

### Establishing Purpose for the WG

In order to create a WG, the purpose of the WG must be established. 
This may be done independently, and/or with the assistance of core delivery team staff and/or brainstorming with other community members and leaders. 
Establishing the purpose of a WG may take a series of brainstorming sessions and workshops, and there are a number of resources that may help with that self organising process. 

*The Turing Way* Research Community Manager or Research Project Manager may also help with that process, in a series of facilitated sessions done at the Collaboration Cafe community call or in a separate set of discussions. 
Please reach out to them if you have any questions about the process, and/or would like some support in getting started. 

A WG may focus on:
1. A specific topic related to or of interest to *The Turing Way* community. (Examples of this may include: localisation, open source infrastructure maintenance, research infrastructure roles, research data management)
2. A type of ongoing task or work currently being done within the project (training, mentoring, reviewing issues/pull requests)
3. Anything else you would like to introduce to the community!

### Proposing a WG

A short proposal should be created on GitHub repository outlining the area of work based on the needs or opportunities identified in the project, community or in the context of the broader open science or research in the scope of *The Turing Way*.
At least 3 to 4 members' intentions and contributions to the proposed area of work are required to create a WG.
The WG should discuss their plan with *The Turing Way* Research Community Manager (RCM) or invite support from other members of the project delivery team.

Once proposed, the RCM will raise this proposal to the rest of the project delivery team, who will discuss the case in the context of the rest of the WGs and projects.
Feedback will be shared directly on the GitHub issue, as well as feedback and interest from the rest of the community will be invited.
Once approved, the RCM will coordinate with the group in helping them access existing resources they might need, as well as create public repository to capture notes and documentation from their work.

### Establishing Roles and Responsibilities

While these roles and responsibilities may shift or evolve during the lifetime of a WG, having initial discussions that enable you to broach topics that will enable you to work together for the during of the WG.

* **Discuss expectations**: Do all founding members have an understanding of the roles and responsibilities listed above to support a WG?
* **Discuss founding membership roles**: How will this group distribute responsibilities in the roles listed above?
* **Discuss working styles**: Has the group assembled for the WG collaborated previously? 
What working styles do people in this group prefer, and how does that affect the cadence, style and communication of the team?
    * Note: Team-building and/or facilitation can be discussed with and/or assisted by the core staff delivery team. 
* **Discuss previous experience with WGs or similar organizational formats**: What did you like about those formats, and what would you avoid? 
What kind of organisational histories do members of this WG come from?
* **Discuss initial goals**: Are there concrete goals that your WG would like to accomplish at its founding? 
Have these goals been scoped appropriately based on resources, availability, and interest? 
    * Note: Frameworks like SMART goals, Agile, Kanban, Scrum methodology may be valuable here.
* **Discuss the group communication plans**: Are there communication tools you might need for your ongoing work (Slack channel, GitHub organisation, emails)

### Logistics for Managing a WG

Once a WG has been established, it is important to identify and discuss the following topics within your group, as this will help to establish the cadence and momentum of the group. 

* **Establish regular meeting times and/or other group communication needs**: How often should the group meet? 
Would they like to use an existing community call (such as Collaboration Cafe) for real-time discussions, or develop a separate call for coworking?
* **Establish a timeline for the WG**: How long should this group be operational? 
Should it be time-bound or shift indefinitely? 
* **Establish roles timeline**: How long should people be appointed in their roles, and how often should these roles change?
* **Create a GitHub repository for organising WG activities**: All WG activities (including notes and the charter, mentioned below) should be archived in The Turing Way GitHub repository. [TEMPLATE LINKED HERE](https://github.com/the-turing-way/working-group-template)
    * Note: In "WG Resources", other infrastructure recommendations and needs (permissions, templates, and checklists are available for you to use) can help with this process.
* **Establish a reporting mechanism and/or public notes archive**: How will you share-out meeting notes and group progress to the wider community?  
    * Note: All WGs should upload notes to their respective GitHub repository [in The Turing Way organisation](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/). For a template, please see this template repository: 
* **Establish appropriate permissions for accounts**: What accounts does this group need access to? 
Does this group have the proper account access and permissions in order to carry out your work?
    * Note: The Community Manager and/or Project Manager can help with this! 
* **Create a WG charter**: Please follow the {ref}`working-groups-charter-template`
    * * Note: All WGs should upload this charter to their respective GitHub repository [in The Turing Way organisation](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/).
* **Create an open calendar invite**: This may require support of a core delivery staff member to add the information to the public google calendar
* **Advertise on Community channels**:  Slack, GitHub, social media and/or the TTW newsletter to share the information about your WG
    * Note: The Community Manager and/or Project Manager can help with this! 
    Ask them on Slack or tag them on GitHub to share out this information, or co-create a communication plan.
* **Create a slack channel for collaboration** (not required - but encouraged): Having an ongoing channel makes it easier to communicate across. 
What other communication channels might this group need?
* **Add information about WG in Ways of Working and/or Governance documents**: Is there a public and up-to-date record of this WG?

### Approving a WG

The approval process for a WG requires a bit more involvement from the wider community and leadership council. 
It is important to understand what resources might be available to support the WG, and/or if the WG's aims are appropriate for the community. 

1. **Completed community charter**: All WGs need to fill out a proposed WG charter ([template here](https://hackmd.io/@aleesteele/template-ttw-wg-charter)) that should be presented to the TTW leadership council and broader community for discusssion and review
2. **Open discussion and/or Q&A**: Discuss your idea in community spaces: such as the TTW Slack workspace, GitHub discussions/issues, and/or Community Calls like the Collaboration Cafe.  
3. **Leadership council approval**: This creation of this WG must be approved by *The Turing Way* leadership council at their regular organisating calls. 
These meetings happen every three months, which you can find out about [in this schedule](https://).

### Maintaining a WG

While initiating a WG, maintaining a WG's activities is integral for the group's success. 

On a quarterly basis, a WG should revisit its structures and ways of working in order to establish that the group is adhering to its established purpose. 
The following questions can be guidelines for doing so. 
These questions have also been compiled into this [WG quarterly audit template]():

* **Review purpose**: Is this WG still fulfilling its established purpose? 
* **Review progress**: Has this working been able to make progress towards its stated goals? 
What adjustments may need to be made in order to support this kind of work?
* **Review process**: Is the existing way of working valuable for this team currently? 
Are there other processes (decision-making, conflict management)
    * Note: The Community Manager and/or Project Manager can help with facilitating this! 
* **Review roles**: Is everyone in the group in a role they would like to stay in? If not, how should these roles change?

### Sunsetting a WG

Deciding when to sunset a WG can be difficult. 
Often, WGs may continue on indefinitely, and while there are a variety of reasons for this, this may be because there are not means of recognising when a group's aims and/or goals have shifted, or if a group's work is no longer needed. 

Reasons for sunsetting a WG can be for the following:
* **Decreased capacity**: Are there no longer enough people to support this WG? 
If the number of people able to sustain a WG decreases to below two, shutting down the WG should be discussed.
* **Disciplinary action**: If there have been any actions taken that may have broken *The Turing Way* code of conduct, the Staff Delivery Team and/or TTW way co-leads reserve the right to retire the WG.
* **Decision from leadership council**: If the actions or projects related to the WG are not seen to be relevant to *The Turing Way* project more broadly, it is possible for the leadership council to disband a WG through a voting process.

Once a group has decided to close down its efforts, consider the following:
* **Document reasons for closing down WG**: Documentation is important for continuous learnings - for future and current WGs, as well as the wider community and even ecosystem that The Turing Way feeds into!
    * If you need help with this documentation process, check out this [template]()
* **Change the meeting information**: Remember to cancel meeting invites, and archive existing notes in the GitHub repository
* **Change the documentation about the group**: Remember to change the information about the groups activity in all spaces where information has been documented
