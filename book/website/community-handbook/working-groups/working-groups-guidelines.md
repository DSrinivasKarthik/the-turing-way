# working Groups: Roles and Responsibilities

All WGs, teams, and people within *The Turing Way* are responsible for adhering with our [Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc) and our [Accessibility Policy](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3145), both in organising WGs and facilitating WGs' activities.

Members of WGs will be responsible for aligning with our working group guiding principles <!-- reformat to reference --> and thus ensuring their efforts are:
1. **Open & Transparent** for others to learn about, and join in on;
2. **Inclusive** for all kinds of people and expertise;
3. **Accessible** to join and participate in.

In this subchapter, we discuss the roles and responsibilities of working group members.
In the next subchapter you will learn about how to propose and manage a working group.

<!-- This content is really intersting but I think its in the wrong place... 
We provide example of structure and roles for different members in the WG.
However, please note that the roles suggested below are not meant to be permanent (for example, a WG chair should not be a permanent appointee), but rather a guiding structure that WGs can begin their work with, and then expand, remix, and reuse for their own purposes.
All roles may be temporarily appointments or long-term, as agreed within the WG.

One person may occupy multiple roles. 
However, one person should not chair multiple WGs, in order to enable diffusion of responsibilities and ensure representation of different members in leadership roles. 

Community members can join any number of WGs, however, we discourage joining more than one or two WGs to prevent over-extension of individuals within the community.

### Chair or Co-Chairs

The Chair or Co-Chairs of a working group provide leadership for the team and facilitate the sustained delivery of the purpose for which the group was created.
The Chair or Co-Chairs are responsible for ensuring the working group's responsibilities are fairly distributed, and ensuring the broader accountability of the assembled group. 

While this role may be occupied by multiple people, it is important to establish how each person upholds the responsibilities of a chair in an equitable way. 

The Chair will serve as the "Liaison" for *The Turing Way* leadership, and will participate in meetings where the representation from the WG in wider governance spaces might be needed. 
Chairs will also be responsible for relaying feedback, announcements and discussions from the leadership or *The Turing Way* delivery team to the WG.
If a chair is unable to represent their WG in a specific meeting, they must identify a member from the WG who can represent the group and share notes from the meeting.

### Documentarian

The documentarian supports the WG in improving transparency around their work, so that those who are not yet part of the WG but are interested in their work can follow or engage with their work.
The documentarian is responsible for ensuring the logistical reporting of the group's work. 
They are are responsible for uploading meeting notes (without any private and sensitive information), helping the chair in time-keeping and communicating about the group's activities in a way that remain transparent, open, and accessible for others to access. 
For example, if the duties of the chair are distributed across multiple people, the documentarian is responsible for documenting this format in the WG's repository.

### *The Turing Way* Delivery Team Contact

While WGs should be able to operate with autonomy in most decisions that apply to their work, sometimes they require help from *The Turing Way* project delivery team to scope and test some ideas of work within their group or make decisions those impact the project and the broader community.

To make it easy to invite support, such as with operational activities, logistics or resources, each WG should have an assigned contact.
It could be a chair or other existing role, or someone else from the WG who keeps the line of communication and connection open with the project delivery team.
In the initial stages of a WG, this person could also be the members of the project delivery team lik the Research Community Manager or Project Manager of *The Turing Way*.

### WG Members

Any Turing Way community member are encouraged to join a WG without restriction, and without taking on a leadership role.

Responsibilities of all Members of the WG include the following, and can adapted in shared in the WG's charter document:

- Providing specific expertise, including identifying emerging challenges and opportunities.
- Reviewing WG's documentation and provide comments, such as on GitHub.
- Attending WG meetings and prepare appropriately to contribute to the agenda, specifically those assigned to them.
- Completing all necessary actions assigned prior to each meeting.
- Supporting the distribution of information to other WG members after each meeting and gather information/feedback.
- Articulating and reflect the interests of community members through community engagement.
- Maintaining a focus on the roadmap co-created with the WG members for the benefit of the broader community.
- Contributing to the documentation of the WG and share them broadly in *The Turing Way* book.
- Representing and share WG's work, recommendations, and accomplishments in the community spaces such as Collaboration Cafe, Community Forum

### Advisors and Experts

This is suggested role that can be invited or appointed by WG in an ad-hoc basis.
An advisor will advise WG about key aspects of the project, provide a community perspective on key considerations, and be a sounding board for deliverables set within a WG.

An advisor or expert's participation in a WG meeting or asynchronous work may include facilitating specific conversations, providing feedback on specific piece of work or supporting WG towards building consensus among members on the desired project goals, building resources, sharing them openly and identifying risks or mitigation measures.

## Infrastructure Requirements for WGs

- Dedicated Github Repository using the template provided in the GitHub organisation
    - Right permissions for members
- Dedicated Slack channel
- A shared document (such as Framapad) for meeting notes (that are archived on GitHub)
- Calendar invites with joining link (ask Research Community Manager for support if needed) for WG meetings

## WG Charter

Each WG should develop a document that centralises information about the WG by providing the purpose of the WG, ways of working, different roles and responsibilities of the WG members, and anything a new member of the WG might need to participate.

We provide a {ref}`working group charter template<ch-working-groups-charter-template>` to help develop this document, which should be shared in the GitHub repository of the WG.

The group charter should provide, to the degree WG members are able to, the following information:

- **Purpose**: a clear statement describing area of WG's work
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: developed based on the guidance provided in this chapter
- **Infrastructure and Resources**: selected by WG to support their work
- **Guiding Principles**: suggestions are provided in the template document
- **Terms of Membership**: WGs can discuss and agree on appropriate terms and length of membership, such as for each role
- **Meetings and Communications**: details about WG meetings, suggestions are provide in the template document
