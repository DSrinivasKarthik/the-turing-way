# Fireside Chat Scripts

```{admonition} Note
:class: tip
These scripts were used to introduce Fireside Chats with _The Turing Way_ between 2022 and 2024, this documentation has been added for archival and transparency purposes.

Before starting the recording, the call would begin with the following note:
```We are recording this session with transcriptions and it will be uploaded to Youtube afterwards. If you do not want to be on the video, please turn off your camera now.```

```
My name is [XXX]. 
I’m the [XXX] for the Turing Way - I’ll be kicking off this session to tell you a little bit more about this call, before passing the mic to XXX, my colleague and XXX of the project, to take it away for this [MONTH] [YEAR] fireside chat.
A few words about The Turing Way, it is an open source, open collaboration and community-developed handbook on data science.
Our goal is to make reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science possible - and to make it both accessible and comprehensible for everyone.
While I am kicking off the session today – I’m part of a wider team that includes XXX and others, many of which are here, and represent the wider & international community of researchers who have created this shared resource.
They themselves bring perspectives from their fields, countries, backgrounds, and lived experiences.

We are hosted by but not exclusive to – The Alan Turing Institute, which is the UK’s national centre for data science and artificial intelligence.
Our project is located in the Tools, Practices, and Systems programme, which we will link in the chat.
The TPS programme helps to strategise and implement open infrastructure within the Institute across various areas of research within the Turing and nationally across the UK.

This Fireside Chat series itself has been an effort towards creating space across the open science communities - and indeed, the wider open ecosystem where people can gather and exchange concerns, explore challenges and share different practices that work in their contexts, to build allyship, and understand each other’s work and perspectives just a little bit better.
