# Community Forums

Since 2024, the Turing Way Project Delivery Team has hosted public community calls.
These open calls welcome current community members, project leaders, and anyone curious about the project â€“ whether they're considering joining our community, using the book, or promoting our work.

These calls offer a space for our community to connect, celebrate successes, and discuss governance.

## Motivation for Organising Community Forums

Community Forums are our public-facing calls to share updates from across {ref}`different levels of governance<fw-governance>` in _The Turing Way_.

### Background

Before launching Community Forums, from June 2022 to September 2023, the Project Delivery Team hosted a regular meeting for the members working at the Maintenance Level.
Over 25 people working across different Working Groups were invited to attend {ref}`Core Community Meetings<ch-community-calls-core-team>` to discuss their work, build standard workflow and improve decision-making processes at the Maintenance Level.
These meetings, although not open to the broader community, discussed community-wide projects and reported updates broadly via our newsletters.

As the community has grown, decision-making processes and structures have also needed different levels of formalisation and transparency, which is why instead of closed meetings, we opted for regular community-wide Community Forums starting in 2024.

These calls are a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.

### Improving Transparency and Decision-Making

Modelled after a political town hall event, Community Forums offer an opportunity to better understand and communicate activities across the project and how decisions are made.

These calls also facilitate decision-making in a more decentralised format. 
This can involve inviting asynchronous feedback via GitHub issues or discussions from the organising body of an initiative (such as a Working Group, funded project, or informal interest group) within _The Turing Way_, relaying feedback from the Maintainer to the Constitutional Level or the Community Level, and vice versa.

Community Forums also serve to inform new and returning community members and actively involve them in discussing governance processes within _The Turing Way_.
Our aim is to leverage the expertise across the open science and data science ecosystem to review our processes and recommend improvements.

## Format

Following a more traditional meeting format, agenda items are prepared in advance of each call.

In a 90 minutes meeting, the agenda allocates time for all three levels of governance with a focus on updates for community members and open invitation to vote or comment on particular issues via GitHub issues.

Below is an overview of what to expect in each Community Forum:

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start (10 mins) | ðŸ‘‹ Welcome & check-in question |
| 15 mins | Community Level Breakout Discussion and Share Out |
| 15 mins | Maintenance Level Working Group Updates |
| 10 mins | Break |
| 10 mins | Constitutional Level Updates|
| 15 mins | Q&A from Community |
| 10 mins | Other updates and celebrations! |
| 05 mins | Closing |

Agenda items are collected based on important matters requiring community information, feedback, or identification of next steps.
Each Working Group is invited to submit a brief update on their respective work and present it to the community during the call.

A corresponding GitHub issue is created for agenda items to facilitate continued discussion beyond the call.

Presentations and discussions are conducted in English, and the calls are recorded for community access via YouTube.
These calls involve live discussions, presentation and screen-sharing, and interactive activities such as through shared note-taking or breakout discussions.

### Hosting Community Forums

Currently, these calls are hosted by the Project Delivery Team.

A member from the Maintainer Level group is invited to chair each call, while the Project Delivery Team manages the logistics, including setting up a Framapad for shared notes, a slide deck to guide the agenda, and a registration form, as well as facilitating the call itself.

In 2025, a Steering Committee, comprising chairs of Working Groups and representatives from projects carried out in collaboration with _The Turing Way_, will be convened to formalise Constitution Level governance.
Future Community Forums will be hosted with their involvement.

## Archived notes and resources

Collaborative notes, capturing feedback and highlights are archived on the [`governance` GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/blob/main/community-forum/README.md).
Slides are published on Zenodo and linked to the repository.
