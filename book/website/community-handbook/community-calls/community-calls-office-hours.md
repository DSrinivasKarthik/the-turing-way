## Office Hours

Office hours were a pilot community call that was trialed from Sept 2022 to March 2023.

This meeting space was trialled to learn more about the community (before joining a collaboration cafe or coworking call - two other types of community calls within _The Turing Way_ community).

This space was created as an informal space to ask questions about the project, join other beginnings in the project, or as a space for informal coffee chats. They were modeled to be one-on-one online help sessions to directly help new community members as they learn more about _The Turing Way_ project. No booking or prior planning was required, and no attendence was tracked to ensure psychological safety and informality of the call.

In 2022 and 2023, these calls were hosted by _The Turing Way_ Community Manager, Anne Lee Steele.  

Similar to other community calls in 2023, the information for this call was hosted on HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/@turingway/office-hours](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/office-hours)

## About "office" or "drop-in" hours

Many academic institutions host office hours or drop-in hours to help students in a one-on-one learning environment. Professors, teaching assistants and/or tutors may host office hours outside of normal class hours to give support about an assignment, discuss topics or questions, and/or answer questions. While they are not limited to students or those specifically seeking help, these sessions generally reach these personas due to the one-on-one question style.

Similarly within the open source community, "office hours" or "drop-in hours" have played a similar role, usually with the aim of reaching beginners and/or newer community members.
