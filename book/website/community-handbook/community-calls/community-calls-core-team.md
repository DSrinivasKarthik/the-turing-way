# Core Team Meetings

```{admonition} Note
:class: tip
Note: These calls were organised every three months from June 2022 to September 2023. While these calls have been retired during the 2024 year (in favor of open community calls related to governance), this documentation has been added for archival and transparency purposes.

## Motivation behind organising

The core team call was initiated to formalise different parts of _The Turing Way_ project and community, as well as initiate the process of decentralised decision-making and governance within the project that went beyond the guides specifically to other types of work.  

These calls were initiated by the Research Community Manager (in 2022, then Anne Lee Steele) in June 2022 in order to formalise, recognise, and celebrate specialised work and/or roles within the project. At the time, this included volunteers to the project across institutions internationally, as well as employees of the Alan Turing Institute based in the United Kingdom, specifically those based in the Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) Programme which hosts _The Turing Way_ project. 

These calls were initiated during a period of significant growth for _The Turing Way_ community and for the TPS team at the Turing, all of which were grouped under the category of "Core Team" of The Turing Way. While these two persona types were 

As the community continued to grow significantly throughout 2022 and 2023 with new work packages and projects, the core team of the project that meet at these calls grew alongside this, as did the need to address blocks for decision-making within the community.  wtihin the community.

This chapter documents this evolution and reason for retiring below. 

## Evolution of call

The first two core team meetings in June 2022 and September 2022 focused on the formalisation of the team as a "Core Team" of The Turing Way. 

In June 2022, the types of work being formalised within the project was related to Translation and Localisation (which had ). The TPS team had also expanded significantly with Research Application Manager (RAM) and Research Community Manager (RCM) roles whose contributions to the project were not clear .

In 
After the meeting of the firFour working groups were incubated: 

By January 2024, this had. The "Reviewers and Editors" 

These calls were formed in order to , and enable collective decision-making within the project.


In 2023, . Four working groups were enabled, which will be described in another chapter.

In these meetings, questions were 

## Format of call

During the period of organising core team calls, the format was iternated on a few times. This was to account for the evolving nature of the team.

## Reasons for retiring

_Last updated: February 2024_ 

These calls were retired in early 2024 due to changes in the governance structure of _The Turing Way project.

The reformated call centers a public "forum"-style call over the format of closed meeting space. These calls were
