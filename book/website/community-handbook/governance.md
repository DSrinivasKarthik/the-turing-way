# Decision making in *The Turing Way*

Decisions within *The Turing Way* community can be made at three different levels.
In this chapter we detail the different levels and you can jump to that information from the list below:

<!-- Turn these into links to later pages -->

1. **Community** level through individual contributors
2. **Maintainance** level through Working Groups and Delivery Groups
3. **Constitutional** level through the Steering Council

  An overview of the three layers of decision making within The Turing Way.
  Across the image is a triangle split into three parts.
  The largest part, on the left, has the title "Community" and there is an image of the GitHub octocat and three different cartoons of people with laptops feeding into that central location using git.
  The next part, in the middle, has the title "Maintainer" and seven circles each containing an icon.
  Four of the circles have a green outline and their icons correspond to the working groups of translation and localisation, infrastructure, accessibility and book dash.
  Three of the circles have an orange outline and their icons correspond to the delivery groups of community management, practitioners hub and JupyterHub community strategy.
  The smallest part of the triangle, on the right, has the title "Constitutional" and there is an icon showing people collaborating together.
  This icon symbolises the Steering Council.
  In the bottom right half of the image is a scriberia cartoon of a mountain of engagement.
  A sign says "Building a Healthy Community" and there are different people walking up a path to the top of the mountain.
  They all look supportive and welcoming, and like they are motivating each other up the mountain.

We also introduce our goverance guiding principles of:

1. **Empowerment** of contributors to participate in decision making processes.
2. **Transparency** of ways of working and how decisions are made.
3. **Inclusion** of diverse perspectives in all areas of the project.

In this chapter you can also find information about the role of a chair or co-chairs of a working group, delivery group and the Steering Council.
