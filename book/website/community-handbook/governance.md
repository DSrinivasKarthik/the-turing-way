# Governance and Decision Making in *The Turing Way*

Governance is a set of formal and informal practices through which an organisation sets goals, assigns responsibilities, establishes systems, and assesses outcomes of organisational action.

Like the book itself, the governance of _The Turing Way_ is always a work in progress!
We are very keen to discuss and improve our governance approaches with the involvement of our community members.

In this section we introduce our goverance guiding principles of:

1. **Empowerment** of contributors to participate in decision making processes.
2. **Transparency** of ways of working and how decisions are made.
3. **Inclusion** of diverse perspectives in all areas of the project.

We also cover how
Decisions within *The Turing Way* community can be made at three different levels.
In this chapter we detail the different levels and you can jump to that information from the list below:

1. {ref}`**Community**<ch-gov-community>` level through individual contributors
2. {ref}`**Maintainance**<ch-gov-maintenance>` level through Working Groups and Delivery Groups
3. {ref}`**Constitutional**<ch-gov-constitutional>` level through the Steering Council

  An overview of the three layers of decision making within The Turing Way.
  Across the image is a triangle split into three parts.
  The largest part, on the left, has the title "Community" and there is an image of the GitHub octocat and three different cartoons of people with laptops feeding into that central location using git.
  The next part, in the middle, has the title "Maintainer" and seven circles each containing an icon.
  Four of the circles have a green outline and their icons correspond to the working groups of translation and localisation, infrastructure, accessibility and book dash.
  Three of the circles have an orange outline and their icons correspond to the delivery groups of community management, practitioners hub and JupyterHub community strategy.
  The smallest part of the triangle, on the right, has the title "Constitutional" and there is an icon showing people collaborating together.
  This icon symbolises the Steering Council.
  There's a diagonal arrow between the Community and Maintenance sections with arrows on both sides.
  The Community side is labelled "Clear pathways to join working and delivery groups".
  The Maintainance side is labelled "Decisions and notes on GitHub".
  There is also a diagonal arrow between Maintenance and Constitutional sections which is labelled "Representation at leadership".
  In the bottom right half of the image is a scriberia cartoon of a mountain of engagement.
  A sign says "Building a Healthy Community" and there are different people walking up a path to the top of the mountain.
  They all look supportive and welcoming, and like they are motivating each other up the mountain.

In this chapter you can also find information about the role of a chair or co-chairs of a working group, delivery group and the Steering Council.
