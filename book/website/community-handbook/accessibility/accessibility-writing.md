### Writing the book
- Describing images & illustrations (Scriberia)
- Understanding the way in which language is used
- Cognitive load & in context of processing disabilities
- Accessibility for beginners -> can link to Community Handbook (avoiding idioms)
- Translation & localisation 
- Writing good practices for data visualisation (not assuming particular IDEs, language-agnostic)

In general, we encourage an approach to Slack that is as accessible as possible, for as many people as possible. Please practice kindness when you communicate with others, and be mindful of cultural, linguistic, disability, and individual differences that may affect how people communicate online.
