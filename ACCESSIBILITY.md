Within The Turing Way community, we define accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social, and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure that all are welcome and are able to enter and participate in research processes, communities and events despite access as it relates to language, disability, and geography. 

While accessibility is commonly understood with respect to disability, we – meaning The Turing Way – define accessibility as giving access to groups of people that encounter different barriers for participation, and in this sense, it overlaps with practices for inclusion. Examples of this may include the language used to communicate within a group of people that may ecludes, access to computing infrastructure, internet connectivity, and more. 

This policy focuses both on accessibility as it relates to disabled people as well as practices that enable broader in of The Turing Way as a book project and wider community. 

This policy is a work in progress, as are the practices that we employ as a community. Much like how The Turing Way itself is always being written and rewritten, our accessibility polities and practices are constantly being updated as broader awareness grows and changes in technology are made.

## Book

- Classic Web Accessibility policy info

### Writing the book
- Describing images & illustrations (Scriberia)
- Understanding the way in which language is used
- Cognitive load & in context of processing disabilities
- Accessibility for beginners -> can link to Community Handbook (avoiding idioms)
- Translation & localisation 
- Writing good practices for data visualisation (not assuming particular IDEs, language-agnostic)

## Tools
As with all of our communication channels, *The Turing Way* communication channels abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc.html).

- Slack
- Emoji
- Github
- Pad - more accessible for writing
- HackMD
- Tinyletter
- Zoom 
- Otter.ai (captions)

* **Images**: Use alt text to describe images, diagrams, or other visuals within ([Learn more about how to do this in this tutorial.](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/resources/using-slack/how-to-boost-accessibility-in-slack&utm_medium=promo)). Don't forget to add important information like context in your description!

* **Links**: If you are inserting a link into a message, limit the number of embedded links within a message. Avoid embedding links within replies to messages when possible, as links posted within threads are not readable for screen readers.
 
* **Emojis**: Limit the use of emojis that break up narrative flows of information where possible (i.e. emojis listed between works). Remember that not all people are able to access the emoji reactions option within Slack, and use written affirmations as well!
* **Bandwidth**: In order to make sure that Slack is accessible in low-bandwidth environments for the community, avoid posting data-intensive content like videos directly into the channels. Instead, prioritise hosting the content on other platforms (i.e. YouTube), and sharing the link.
* **Openness**: Remember that not everyone in the *The Turing Way* community is in the Slack workspace – or on every social media channel. Where possible – especially when discussing chapter ideas and other collaborations – create issues and discussions on the Github repository or post across social media channels, in order to ensure the widest reach and participation possible.

In general, we encourage an approach to Slack that is as accessible as possible, for as many people as possible. Please practice kindness when you communicate with others, and be mindful of cultural, linguistic, disability, and individual differences that may affect how people communicate online.
