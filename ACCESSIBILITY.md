# Accessibility Policy

Within The Turing Way community, we define accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social, and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure that all are welcome and are able to enter and participate in research processes, communities and events despite access as it relates to language, disability, and geography. 

While accessibility is commonly understood with respect to disability, we – meaning The Turing Way – define accessibility as giving access to groups of people that encounter different barriers for participation, and in this sense, it overlaps with practices for inclusion. Examples of this may include the language used to communicate within a group of people that may ecludes, access to computing infrastructure, internet connectivity, and more. 

This policy focuses both on accessibility as it relates to disabled people as well as practices that enable broader in of The Turing Way as a book project and wider community. 

This policy is a work in progress, as are the practices that we employ as a community. Much like how The Turing Way itself is always being written and rewritten, our accessibility polities and practices are constantly being updated as broader awareness grows and changes in technology are made.
