Within The Turing Way community, we define accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social, and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure people with disabilities are welcome and are able to enter and participate in research processes, communities and events.

Accessibility can also be understood as giving access to groups of people that encounter different barriers for participation, and in this sense, it overlaps with practices for inclusion. Indeed, accessibility practices originally designed for disabled people improve and enhance the participation of people with no disabilities. This guide will focus in accessibility related to disabled people but will point out when these practices can be beneficial to everyone.

## Best Practices for using Slack

As with all of our communication channels, *The Turing Way* slack abides by our [Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc.html).

We are in the process of developing platform-specific guidelines for Slack and other community platforms. While these are being developed, here are a few general guidelines to get you started:

* **Images**: Use alt text to describe images, diagrams, or other visuals within ([Learn more about how to do this in this tutorial.](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/resources/using-slack/how-to-boost-accessibility-in-slack&utm_medium=promo)). Don't forget to add important information like context in your description!

* **Links**: If you are inserting a link into a message, limit the number of embedded links within a message. Avoid embedding links within replies to messages when possible, as links posted within threads are not readable for screen readers.
* **Emojis**: Limit the use of emojis that break up narrative flows of information where possible (i.e. emojis listed between works). Remember that not all people are able to access the emoji reactions option within Slack, and use written affirmations as well!
* **Bandwidth**: In order to make sure that Slack is accessible in low-bandwidth environments for the community, avoid posting data-intensive content like videos directly into the channels. Instead, prioritise hosting the content on other platforms (i.e. YouTube), and sharing the link.
* **Openness**: Remember that not everyone in the *The Turing Way* community is in the Slack workspace – or on every social media channel. Where possible – especially when discussing chapter ideas and other collaborations – create issues and discussions on the Github repository or post across social media channels, in order to ensure the widest reach and participation possible.

In general, we encourage an approach to Slack that is as accessible as possible, for as many people as possible. Please practice kindness when you communicate with others, and be mindful of cultural, linguistic, disability, and individual differences that may affect how people communicate online.
